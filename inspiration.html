I've noticed a similar website format in common across some of my favorite academics. They tend to be very basic and to the point, without any modern bells and whistles. The sites I like most combine that minimalist aesthetic with small surprises that are unexpected given the website's austere first impression. The list below is a "museum" of such sites that I've encountered and will continue to update as I find more. Many of them contain useful references and information or otherwise entertaining writings. Thank you to anyone who has shared examples with me. Inclusion here is not an endorsement. Some of these were used as inspiration in the creation of my own website.<br>
